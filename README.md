# SpensesDex 

SpensesDex is a full-stack React project that tracks expenses by amount, category, and description. Each expense is grouped into boxes 
that we can see by clicking the "show boxes" button. We are able to add and remove the boxes, at the same time 'POST' and 'DELETE' each box 
from the database. It uses json-server as the database to store/watch the data in the db.json file. It is a great exercise to practice
the fundamentals of React, manipulate the state/DOM, get comfortable with fetching data by playing with HTTP requests. I have also put comments on some of the mistakes I have made to act as reminder and help with debugging. 

*Next upgrades will include new menus and a PUT request to edit the boxes.*
